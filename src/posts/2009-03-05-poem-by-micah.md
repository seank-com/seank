T'was during World War II,
I had a red balloon.
It was much like a fish,
And it glowed as the moon.
I also had a suit
With pom-poms on each boot.
It had a robot pup;
The pup could play the flute.
I had a bottle too,
That, when I pulled the ring,
It made a little "Pop!",
And out came lots of string.
But all these things are gone;
I do not have them now.
For during World War II,
My stuff just went, "Ka-pow!"

I made this corny little poem as a school assignment, and got dad to LOL.
