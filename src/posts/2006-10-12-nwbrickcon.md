We were blessed with a happy accident this last weekend. We were intending to go see the Dead Sea Scrolls at the Pacific Science Center, however, upon arriving we learned that the exhibit was sold out for the day and so whilst wandering around the Seattle Center wondering what to do with our day, we discovered that this weekend was the annual NWBrickCon! We saw all kinds of lego creations and I expect this will become an annual event for our family.
