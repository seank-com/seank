While this man is clearly on the other side of the fence from me with regard to a few of his "facts", he does present what at first blush seems to like a reasonable set of questions?

While I think I agree with what he is getting at, I find it amusing how many of his questions (and statements) contradict each other. I'll break one of his rules also and leave pointing them out as an exercise for the reader.
