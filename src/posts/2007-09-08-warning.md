So I come home from work yesterday evening. I've been working late this first week in Septemeber and probably will be for the next 6 weeks or so. Anyway, as I come through the garage door I see a curious sign posted over (yes over) our bathroom door downstairs. I mention this to my wife and she calmly explains that Lydia (our three year old) had zealously tried to help the family by cleaning the downstairs bathroom. In the process she half emptied an aerasol can of Lysol disinfectant spray. (this has instigated some serious training and retraining). Micah (my 11 year old) became concerned that exposure to such a high concentration (apparently it freshened the entire house for several hours) of chemicals might cause health concerns and so he posted this sign on his own initiative.
