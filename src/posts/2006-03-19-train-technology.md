While riding a train from Seattle down to Los Angeles, I was surprised to find a Windows desktop computer with a copy of Microsoft Streets and Trips connected to a GPS. You can't really see the screen well in the photo, but it sure was nice to be able to show the kids where we were and how far we had left to go. The trip took almost 40 hours, so you can imagine how nice it was to be able to answer the "Are we there yet?" question. I found out later that this wasn't provided by the railroad company but rather a conductor had seen the Microsoft Streets and Trips GPS bundle at Costco and bought it to install on an old home machine for the passengers. What a neat guy.
