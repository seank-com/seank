When I was in school I learned a mnemonic for remembering the digits in Pi. Simply count the number of the letters in each word of the phrase: "Yes, I shot a moose yesterday as George drove"

When you do this you get 3.14159265

Late last year, my daughter came to work with me and for fun she worked on extending it out to the following phrase: "Yes, I shot a moose yesterday as George drove you crazy insanely bantering because Elisabeth had to say brothers need wisdom to vacuum your rug and remember not to reserve uncovered pizza."

This gives you the much more impressive 3.1415926535897932384626433832795

Unfortunately, we had to stop there as the next digit in Pi is 0.
