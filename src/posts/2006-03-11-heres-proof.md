Most of my friends don't believe me when I tell them that my kids favorite restaurant is Sushiland. They love the conveyor belt thing and they are willing to try stuff I won't even eat. I didn't start eating Sushi myself until I started working in the Windows division at Microsoft. The only thing my coworkers would do together outside of work is eat Sushi, so I learned to enjoy it. Now the whole family gets excited if I suggest going out for dinner.
