I recieved an e-mail this morning about Mr. Moore. He is a judge in Alabama who was sued by the ACLU for refusing to remove the Ten Commandments that were hung in his court room foyer. After he was removed from office he wrote the following poem:

America the beautiful,
or so you used to be.
Land of the Pilgrim's pride;
I'm glad they'll never see.
Babies piled in dumpsters,
Abortion on demand,
Oh, sweet land of liberty,
your house is on the sand.
Our children wander aimlessly
poisoned be cocaine
choosing to induldge their lusts,
when GOD has said abstain.
From sea to shining sea,
our Nation turns away
From the teachings of GOD's love
and a need to always pray.
We've kept GOD in our temples,
how callous we have grown.
When earth is but His footstool,
and Heaven is His throne.
We've voted in a goverment
that's rotten at the core,
Appointing GODless Judges;
who throw reason out the door,
Too soft to place a killer
in a well deserved tomb,
but brave enough to kill a baby
before he leaves the womb.
You think that GOD's not angry
that our lands a moral slum?
How much longer will He wait
before His judgment comes?
How are we to face our GOD
from who we cannot hide?
What then is left for us to do,
but stem this evil tide?
If we who are his children,
will humbly turn and pray;
Seek His holly face
and mend our   evil way:
Then GOD will hear from Heaven;
and forgive us of our sins,
He'll heal our sickly land
and those who   live within.
But, America the beautiful,
If you don't then you will see,
A sad but Holy GOD
withdraw His hand from Thee.
- Judge Roy Moore

I humbly ask for prayer for him, please bless him as you go about your day.

Your sister in CHRIST
- Hannah
