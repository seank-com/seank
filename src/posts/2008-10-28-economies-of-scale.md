Scale is a real thing. I remember when I broke the build on the Windows team. I had to go to a special meeting and explain to leadership how I would never do it again. We weren't allowed to break the build even once. They explained it quite simply. At the time we had 2,000 engineers working on Windows. They said if each engineer only breaks the build once a year, we'd have 6 builds breaks per day.
