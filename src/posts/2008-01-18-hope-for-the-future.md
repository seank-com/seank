This morning, Micah was holding Miriam while doing his reading assignment. Later he was asked in his English assignment to write a descriptive paragraph and here is what he wrote.

**A young child makes time go backwards. When you hold her, warmth bursts into your body. She is a rainbow, and her eyes are always watching. She removes your frowns and gives smiles to the world.**
