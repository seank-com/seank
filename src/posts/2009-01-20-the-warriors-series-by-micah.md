Hello again! Recently, my grandmother gave our family a set of books (Warriors), and ever since I haven't been able to stop reading. The books are awesome! They're about four groups (Clans) of wild cats, and not lions and tigers, but housecat-sized cats who live in the forest and have their own set of beliefs and codes that they follow. As cats in the clans progress in age, they go through different levels of life, starting with kithood and progressing all the way to the rank of elder (kit, apprentice, warrior, elder). There are also three other ranks: medicine cat, deputy, and leader. Each rank holds special priveledges. Read for yourself and see!
