I came across two interesting sites today. The first sells a soap that teaches children how to wash their hands while they are washing their hands. Kind of a learn by doing approach. The trick is that the dispenser has an ink blotter on top that will dispense an ink mark on your childs hand when they dispense the soap. The ink is designed to come off after 15-20 seconds of scrubbing.

The second site I found from an article about using a [timer to help your children learn to concentrate](http://www.parenthacks.com/2006/09/set_the_timer_t.html). Perhaps I should consider this technique as opposed to the lecture approach that tends to get [abstracted and abstracted and overly generalized](http://www.seank.com/2006/9/14/things-that-make-you-go-hmmm.html).
