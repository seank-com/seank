Each year our family looks forward to going to Hope Lodge up on Steven's Pass to spend a weekend with 5-6 families composed of several dozen children. This year one of older boys brough his camcorder and put together this video. Aside from a hike on the Iron Goat trail. What you see in the video is pretty much all we did all day long.
