Almost every Labor day weekend for that last 4 years, we have gone over to the Spokane, WA area. One of the places we always make a point of going to is the [White Elephant](http://www.whiteelephantstores.com/). Essentially a toy store for kids of all ages. It's also located two blocks from a Salvation Army Thrift store so mom is happy too.
