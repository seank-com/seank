Look forward to a great post on Xbox Media Center and python scripting therein. I've been working really hard at work to put together some great stuff but I'm not quite ready to share.

Until then I did want to shout out to Alex, who submitted a great post on folding roses from maple leaves. As the owner of a larger maple tree and the proud husband of a very creative wife and father of 4 very creative children, I'm sure this will make the fall season very interesting around our home.
