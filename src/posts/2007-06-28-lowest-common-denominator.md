## What American accent do you have?

**Your Result: The West**

Your accent is the lowest common denominator of American speech. Unless you're a SoCal surfer, no one thinks you have an accent. And really, you may not even be from the West at all, you could easily be from Florida or one of those big Southern cities like Dallas or Atlanta.

I agree with the conclusion, I just don't like the way they worded it. I guess I don't stand out in a crowd.
