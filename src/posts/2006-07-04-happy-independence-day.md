This year, the first thing we did to celebrate Independence Day was complete our bunkbed project. During the last part of last year we bought outstanding [online plans](http://www.bunkbedsunlimited.com/detail.aspx?ID=71) to build our own triple bunkbed for our three girls. We bought the wood using gift certificates we received over the holidays. On Saturdays in January and February we cut, routed, sanded and drilled the wood. In early March we primed it. Just last week we painted it and this morning we assembled it amidst much celebration.

For now we are using sleeping bags and camping pads, but we will get real mattresses eventually. Now we are heading over to have steak and shrimp with the family and then toward dark we are planning to go to the Chris' home in unincorporated King County where we will "light the night fantastic."
