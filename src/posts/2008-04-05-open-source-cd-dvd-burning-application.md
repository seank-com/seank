Because of a weird twist of fate, my new computer did not come with any software to burn CDs or DVDs even though it has a burner. Last night, at 12:30am, I really needed to burn a CD before going to bed. I tried Microsoft's built in CD burner, but it failed. Actually it never started. I couldn't seem to convince it that I had actually inserted a blank CD. So I hit the internet trail and came across an outstanding open source CD/DVD burnning application called [InfraRecorder](http://infrarecorder.sourceforge.net/). In the span of 15 mintues this application has earned a place in my short list of must install applications for Windows PCs.
