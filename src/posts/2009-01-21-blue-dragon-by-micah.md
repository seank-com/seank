Hello again! This time, I'm posting about one of my favorite movie series, Blue Dragon. This series is about six adventurous youths, on a quest to stop their nemesis, Lord Nene, ruler of the Gran Kingdom (yes, I know, but that's how it's spelled) and intent on controlling the world. As the group travels from village to village, past stopping at the defeat of Nene, they find new friends and learn how to control and strengthen their ultimate weapon, shadows. From simple villages to flying fortresses, this is truly an unforgettable adventure.
