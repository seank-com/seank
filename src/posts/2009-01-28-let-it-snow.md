At a bridal shower my mom and I went to on saturday, it started snowing. Of course we didn't find out until one of my freinds, with dark brown hair, went out side. By the next morning there was snow all over. A day later there was ice on the ground and roads. Luckily no one got hurt. Snows fun, but not right now.

I hope it won't countinue.

Thats all,
Hannah
