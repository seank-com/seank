The guys over at Websurity present you with [Uncomfortable Questions: Was The Death Star Attack An Inside Job?](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/was-the-death-star-attack-an-inside-job/) There isn't a better way to communicate to the Entertainment Generation just how absurd the conspiracies surrounding 9/11 are than this.
