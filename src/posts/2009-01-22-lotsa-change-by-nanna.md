Today Dad decided to take a 3-gallon bucket half filled with coins to First Tech. When he put it on the counter the banker said "Wow thats a lot of change!!!!". Turns out there were 2,838 pennies, 766 nickels, 1,376 dimes, 1,556 quarters, and 1 half dollar. That comes to a total of $593.78 . Which is almost $600. I think it's safe to say we had a fortune right under our noses and after about five years we finally realized it.

See'ya
