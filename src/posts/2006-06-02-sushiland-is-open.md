Our families favorite restuarant opened a new location in downtown Redmond. While we were only the second ones there. I'm sure we had several first among use. First soy sauce dripped on the table. First rice spilled on the floor. First nose and hand prints on the glass windows. A good time was had by all. Here is a before and after shot I took with my cellphone.
