I'm new at this so go easy on me.

For my birthday I got a series called The Power of Three. It's a story about three young, recently apprenticed, cats called Jaypaw, Hollypaw, and Lionpaw. After the Clans travel to the lake, three cats are born to Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw. These cats hold all the power of the Clans combined. From chasing foxes as kits to traveling to the mountains, all the way to arguing over skills; these cats get in and out of trouble everywhere they go. This is a truly interesting series that I would suggest for any animal or action loving person. These are so good I can't get my nose out of them.

See ya!!
