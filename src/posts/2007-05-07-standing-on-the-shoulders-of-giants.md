I saw this [link](http://www.unfocusedbrain.com/projects/match_color/) on the blogs last week and several big blogs have picked it up today. What is exciting to me is not a new photoshop technique but a very novel perspective. The author asks the question, "The Old Masters of painting spent years of their lives learning about color. Why let all their effort go to waste on the walls of some museum when it could be used to give you a hand with color correction?" How cool is that? I want to think like that!
