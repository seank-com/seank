The local McDonalds has remodeled their kids place.

The new climbing apparatus is much bigger, making it easier for larger children and even adults to get in on the fun.

They also have a set of hoops and plenty of balls for shotting.

They even have a computer game you play by peddling a bike. They also have a dancing game, but none of the kids here could figure out how to operate it.
