One of the things I enjoy alot is my time around the dinner table with my family is the weird stuff I find on the internet. It seems like everyday, I come home with something interesting to talk about that I saw on the internet. Here is the list for tonight.

First, Tim Tucker has come up with a great idea. Merging the fun of play Tetirs, with the bored of regular exercise. Checkout [Tetris Weightlifting](https://web.archive.org/web/20150223032417/http://tetrisweightlifting.com/howitworks.php). This is a lot more exciting that [Dance Dance Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution). Primarily, because I don't have to put quarters dollars in a machine each time to exercise, and I love Tetris.

Schwinn has a line of [electric bikes](https://www.schwinnbikes.com/collections/electric-bikes). The motors are in the front hub and the batteries are very small and very high power.

Finally, someone has slowed down [Alvin and the Chimpmonks](https://ontheaside.com/uncategorized/alvin-and-the-chipmunks-slowed-down-makes-awesome-sludge-pop/) so you can hear how the real singers sound. This is almost a homeschool science and technology unit study in the making.
