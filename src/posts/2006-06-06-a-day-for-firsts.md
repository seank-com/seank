Whilst perusing my [favorite homepage](https://upstract.com/) I came across 2 stories that are really interesting. I feel the ich to post something today, probably because it'is sunny in Seattle and I am trying to avoid work.

First, scientist believe they have discovered the [oldest astronomy computer](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56377567). How cool is that. I've often wondered how different life would be for me if I had be born out of time. Would I have been a mediocre farmer with an incredible untapped talent? It's reassuring to know that computers, in one form or another, have been around for a long, long time.

Second, a different set of scientists believe [figs were likely humans' first crop](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2006/06/figs-likely-first-domesticated-crop/). Now fig newtons have always been one of my favorite kinds of cookies so this doesn't really surprise me. However, the article stated:

**"These figs, however, do not produce seeds and can't reproduce on their own. Reproduction can occur only if humans plant shoots. Thus, the existence of the figs means that husbandry was taking place."**

What I really wanted to know was how a plant that can only reproduce with human intervention can exist billions and billions of years while humans evolve to the point of being able assist them in reproducing. Does anyone else worry about these kinds of things?

_**Update:** updated links._
